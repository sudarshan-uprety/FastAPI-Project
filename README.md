Welcome to my fastAPI project! This project is a simple web application where users can create an account, login, create posts, and vote on posts. All the functionalities are implemented using a REST API and the documentation makes it easy for users to understand and use the API.

The project uses Postgres as the database for storing user information, posts, and votes. It is deployed on Heroku, a cloud-based platform that makes it easy to deploy, manage, and scale web applications.
